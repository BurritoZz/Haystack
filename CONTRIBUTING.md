# How to contribute to Haystack-Ada

:tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada:

### Did you find a bug?
* Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [issues](https://github.com/BurritoZz/Haystack-Ada/issues)
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/BurritoZz/Haystack-Ada/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample, test case or set of instructions demonstrating the expected behaviour that is not occurring.

### Submitting changes
* Before doing anything, if you're submitting a code change, make sure to run black on your repository to make sure your code conforms to our code styling.
* Please send a [Github Pull Request to Haystack-Ada](https://github.com/BurritoZz/Haystack-Ada/pull/new/main) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](help.github.com/pull-requests/)).
* When you send a pull request containing code changes, we will love you forever if you include a pytest test case demonstrating the change in behaviour.

### Coding conventions
* We format our code to satisfy pylint and black.
  * To satisfy black, you can run black on your local repository to format the code automatically.
  * For pylint, you'll need to format the code manually.
